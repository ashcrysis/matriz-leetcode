# Matriz LeetCode - Challenge Repository

Welcome to **Matriz LeetCode**! This repository was created to organize our technical challenges, allowing us to collaborate, review, and improve together. Here's how we organize our projects into branches and pull requests (PRs).

## Branch Structure

### Main Branch
Each participant will have their own main branch following the naming convention: `branch-yourname-main`.

**Example:**
- Ash will have a main branch called `branch-ash-main`.
- Lucas will have a main branch called `branch-lucas-main`.

### Challenge Branch
For each challenge, you will create a specific branch following the naming convention: `leet-challenge-yourname`.

**Example:**
- For a to-do list challenge, Ash will create the branch `leet-to-do-list-ash`.
- For a to-do list challenge, Lucas will create the branch `leet-to-do-list-lucas`.

## Workflow:

- Each participant should create their main branch following the pattern `branch-yourname-main`.
- After that, they should create a branch based on their main, following the pattern `leet-challenge-yourname`, and within it, follow the structure: `projects > current project`.
- The participant will send commits with updates (do not send everything at once to AVOID sending project files for PR review).
- After finishing, open the PR to your own main branch and request approval from at least 3 people.

## Creating PRS, Reviewing PRs
The convention name for your Pull Request should be something like `Leet #task-name | Your-Name -> PR #PullVersion`, for example -> `Leet #to-do | Ash -> PR #0`  
And remember the following rules:
- Your PR WILL be cancelled if  you try to merge into the project main directory, you have to make your PR's into your main directory => `branch-yourname-main`.
- When reviewing a Pull Request, try to give tips of where to improve, or things we could do better, but don't be a jerk, only comment useful things to improvement, and approve the PR when you find it is okay.
- Remember to make a nice description on each PR, explaining what you are merging, what you have done and why you have done, explain how to run the project, etc.
- Your PR must have `@ashcrysis` and `@j0jds` as a reviewer, the third one can be anyone, feel free to choose.
