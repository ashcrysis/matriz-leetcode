# Matriz LeetCode - Challenge Repository

Welcome to **Matriz LeetCode**! This repository was created to organize our technical challenges, allowing us to collaborate, review, and improve together. Here's how we organize our projects into branches and pull requests (PRs).

## Branch Structure

### Main Branch
Each participant will have their own main branch following the naming convention: `branch-yourname-main`.

**Example:**
- Ash will have a main branch called `branch-ash-main`.
- Lucas will have a main branch called `branch-lucas-main`.

### Challenge Branch
For each challenge, you will create a specific branch following the naming convention: `leet-challenge-yourname`.

**Example:**
- For a to-do list challenge, Ash will create the branch `leet-ash-to-do-list`.
- For a to-do list challenge, Lucas will create the branch `leet-lucas-to-do-list`.

## Workflow:

- Each participant should create their main branch following the pattern `branch-name-main`.
- After that, they should create a branch based on their main, following the pattern `leet-challenge-yourname`, and within it, follow the structure: `projects > current project`.
- The participant will send commits with updates (do not send everything at once to AVOID sending project files for PR review).
- After finishing, open the PR to your own main branch and request approval from at least 3 people.
